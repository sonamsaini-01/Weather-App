# Weather-App
This is my first Git repository and I'm making a weather website.
A simple, beautiful, and user-friendly weather application that provides real-time weather data for any city in the world. This app features a dynamic, animated background that changes based on the current weather conditions, creating an immersive and delightful user experience.
